# GinBookStore
Simple Rest API with Golang and Gin Framework.

The API uses sqlite3 so there will be a sqlite3 file created named as 'data.db' after the server started

You can get imports by running 
```
$ go get .
```
Then start the server by
```
$ go run .
```
The server starts on 8080 port and you can reach the the API via http://localhost:8080/api/v1/
You can do CRUD operations by interacting with the API
